# Getting Started with Create React App (CRA)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## CRA Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\
Build process can take 1-15 minutes, especially with GitHub Actions.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

As written below, this project is bootstrapped with CRA and some configurations may not be optimized for your use case. If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. There are also alternatives to `eject` that you can use to customize your build process without ejecting. You can check one of these: rewire, CRACO, react-app-rewired .

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Commit Messages

This project uses commitizen with the cz-emoji extension to standardize commit messages. To use it, run `yarn commit` instead of `git commit` after staging your changes. You will be prompted to select a commit type and write a commit message. You can select the commit type by typing keywords or with arrow keys. The commit message will be automatically formatted according to the commit type. For more information, see [commitizen/cz-cli](
